I have Astar completed in structure and in function. Unfortunately I stopped trying to fix the bugs so there are problems where players get a null pointer and the old problem of the player teleporting rears its head (I did figure out that it has nothing to do with the timer but that made me jsut give up cuz I had no where to go from there) All in all its mostly complete with the occasional problem.
